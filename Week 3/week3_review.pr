2y Great job! The program outputs the name of the representative and their title. I appreciate the comment which shows which areas they cover.
zm Great job, program outputs the name of the representative.
sp Nice job! The output is a statement outlining who the representatives are of SF County.
f2 Program outputs name of the assembly member. I suggest if outputting a human-reading sentence with the intent of being read by someone else, to use full punctuation instead of all lower-case. I also suggest to delete extra space characters at the end of the program, as it looks like there are 2 empty new-line spaces. 
ai Nice comment! I suggest to add the comment inside of a print('') statement instead of a comment in order to be consistent with the assignment. When you execute the program, nothing occurs and makes it appear like there is no further information.
r8 The statement implies the writer does not know their CA state rep. It is unclear wether or not the student is in CA, but if they are not, I would have appreciated either knowing who their state rep is anyway or any further clarifying information.
tu N/A This program was intended for previous week (Week 2). The code looks good, however!
