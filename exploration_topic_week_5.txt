Question 1:
Topic Start - Copy the text below into your discussion post.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurant_shifts;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurant_employees;

-- Create a table named restaurant_employees with columns for id, name, and position
CREATE TABLE restaurant_employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(50)
);
If you ran the following SELECT statement to view the newly created tables in your database, what do you predict would appear in the query result?

-- SELECT #1
SELECT * FROM restaurant_employees;
Run the following INSERT statement:

-- INSERT #1
INSERT INTO restaurant_employees (employee_id, name, position) VALUES (1, 'Maria Garcia', 'Manager');
Run the SELECT #1 statement to view the impact of INSERT #1 on the tables. How would you describe the result of INSERT #1 using everyday (not programming) language?

Run the following INSERT statement:

-- INSERT #2
INSERT INTO restaurant_employees VALUES (2, 'Ahmed Ali', 'Chef');
How does the use of the INSERT statement in INSERT #2 differ from INSERT #1?

Run the SELECT #1 statement to view the impact of INSERT #2 on the tables.  How does the results of INSERT #2 differ from the result of INSERT #1?

Run the INSERT #1 statement again:

-- INSERT #1
INSERT INTO restaurant_employees (employee_id, name, position) VALUES (1, 'Maria Garcia', 'Manager');
This should produce an error message.

What is the error message?

What do you think it means?

Run the following INSERT statement:

-- INSERT #3
INSERT INTO restaurant_employees VALUES (3, 'Liu Wei');
This should produce an error.

How does the use of the statement INSERT #3 differ from the use of INSERT #2 (which ran successfully)?

What is the error message and what do you think it means?

Run the following INSERT statement:

-- INSERT #4
INSERT INTO restaurant_employees (employee_id, name) VALUES (3, 'Liu Wei');
How does the text of INSERT #4 statement differ from the text of INSERT #3?

How does the text of INSERT #4 statement differ from the text of INSERT #1?
Run the SELECT #1 statement to view the impact of INSERT #4 on the tables.  How does the results of INSERT #4 differ from previous inserts and why?

How do you think the INSERT statement works? What rules would you define for its use?

Question 2:
Murach's MySQL 3rd ed. Chapter 4: Exercise 7
Use the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of two columns from the Vendors table:

vendor_name
vendor_state.
If the vendor is in California, the vendor_state value should be “CA”; otherwise, the vendor_state value should be “Outside CA.” Sort the final result set by vendor_name.

The following question has been developed to provide some feedback to a new programmer. If answered correctly, you should see a correctly formatted SQL statement that answers the programming problem.

What is the vendor_state for the 2nd record in the query result set?
