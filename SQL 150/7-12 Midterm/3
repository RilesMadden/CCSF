Code example 7-1

SELECT vendor_name, COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices, MAX(invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) AS balance_due

each vendor with the number of invoices and the maximum balance due
where the balance due is greater than the average of all invoices

FROM vendors v
  JOIN invoices i
  ON v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id 
WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total >
    (SELECT AVG(invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total)
    FROM invoices)
GROUP BY vendor_name
ORDER BY balance_due DESC

When this query is executed, the result set will contain
one row for each invoice that has a larger balance due than the average balance due for all invoices
one row for the invoice with the largest balance due for each vendor
one row for each invoice for each vendor that has a larger balance due than the average balance due for all invoices
--> one row for each vendor that shows the largest balance due for any of the vendors invoices, but only if the balance due is larger than the average balance due for all invoices
