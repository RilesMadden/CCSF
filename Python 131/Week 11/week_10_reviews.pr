7d Great job! Code executes without error and gives expected result. I appreciated the structure as well as the error handling at the end if no integers were submitted. I also appreciated how you used the weeks lesson of try and except in your program to ensure all bases were covered.
77 Nice job, code executes without error and gives expected result. Comments were concise and easy to understand.
xe Nice job! Code executes without error. You could simplify your calculation by using the sum() method, which natively does the for loop and sums it. Since you already know you only have integers in your list, it would be safe to use.
uv Great job! Code executes without error and gives expected result. I liked the structure of the code and found it easy to follow what was happening. I would suggest to consider using some in-line comments in addition to your above-line comments as it can be tricky to have to skip over every other line if many indents are used.
zp Great job, simple and to the point. You can probably combine both of your except lines into just except: Pass as you aren't doing any unique error handling for each error type, and this way will catch all of them. I do like the idea of separating by error type, however. 
pn Nice job, code executes without error and gives expected result. I appreciated your structure and comments as they were easy to follow. If I had to make a suggestion, it would be to consider using a more descriptive element for your sum variable as it can be helpful when there are multiple variables to keep track of. Something like sum_of_integer_args. Keep up the good work!
zz Nice job! Code executes successfully and without error. If I had to make a suggestion, it would be to consider combining the functionality of some of your lines. During your function, you could add the value to the list at that time as you know if it will be an integer.
