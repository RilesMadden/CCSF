g9 Code output is concise, and the code itself is easy to read. Great job! My only recommendation would be to include how you calculated the people-to-supervisor ratio, as it isn't obvious from your output statement.
vh Great job! I appreciate the logical work through of the problem. My only note is that you could try to remove the space between the population number and the period in the first 2 output lines.
6k Great job! Code is very concise and easy to follow. My only suggestion would be to define your 'comparison' variables a bit more explicitly, because it isn't obvious what comparison is taking place here. It could be 'difference_between_sf_la' or something similar, but that is just my preference.
jf Code is short and easy to follow, good job! I would recommend to include the word "approximately" or something similar when you are rounding numbers.
gr Good job! I appreciate the citations in your program output. I don't think the extra new line spaces '\n' are needed, and other than that it looks good.
ev The program output reads well, I appreciate the commas in the numbers to make it easier. You also did it in a way that I didn't know about but is much easier, so thank you! Otherwise, you can simplify your print statements when you use an f string by placing the f at the beginning, like this: print(f"Hello my name is {name}, nice to meet you!")
m2 Code is well structured, however there is an error in the math for calculating the ratio. You just needed to divide the averages against each other, so dividing by the populations is unnecessary. Other than that, the code is structured and explained well.
