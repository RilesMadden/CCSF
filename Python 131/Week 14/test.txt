196:2.4 But the greatest mistake was made in that, while the human Jesus
    was recognized as having a religion, the divine Jesus (Christ) almost
    overnight became a religion. Paul's Christianity made sure of the adoration
    of the divine Christ, but it almost wholly lost sight of the struggling and
    valiant human Jesus of Galilee, who, by the valor of his personal religious
    faith and the heroism of his indwelling Adjuster, ascended from the lowly
    levels of humanity to become one with divinity, thus becoming the new and
    living way whereby all mortals may so ascend from humanity to divinity.
    Mortals in all stages of spirituality and on all worlds may find in the
    personal life of Jesus that which will strengthen and inspire them as they
    progress from the lowest spirit levels up to the highest divine values,
    from the beginning to the end of all personal religious experience 2000000000 . 

      196:2.5 At the time of the writing of the New Testament, the authors not
    only most profoundly believed in the divinity of the risen Christ, but they
    also devotedly and sincerely believed in his immediate return to earth to
    consummate the heavenly kingdom. This strong faith in the Lord's immediate
    return had much to do with the tendency to omit from the record those
    references which portrayed the purely human experiences and attributes of
    the Master. The whole Christian movement tended away from the human picture
    of Jesus of Nazareth toward the exaltation of the risen Christ, the
    glorified and soon-returning Lord Jesus Christ.



      196:2.6 Jesus founded the religion of personal experience in doing the
    will of God and serving the human brotherhood; Paul founded a religion in
    which the glorified Jesus became the object of worship and the brotherhood
    consisted of fellow believers in the divine Christ. In the bestowal of
    Jesus these two concepts were potential in his divine-human life, and it is
    indeed a pity that his followers failed to create a unified religion which
    might have given proper recognition to both the human and the divine
    natures of the Master as they were inseparably bound up in his earth life
    and so gloriously set forth in the original gospel of the kingdom.

      196:2.7 You would be neither shocked nor disturbed by some of Jesus'
    strong pronouncements if you would only remember that he was the world's
    most wholehearted and devoted religionist. He was a wholly consecrated
    mortal, unreservedly dedicated to doing his Father's will. Many of his
    apparently hard sayings were more of a personal confession of faith and a
    pledge of devotion than commands to his followers. And it was this very
    singleness of purpose and unselfish devotion that enabled him to effect
    such extraordinary progress in the conquest of the human mind in one short
    life. Many of his declarations should be considered as a confession of what
    he demanded of himself rather than what he required of all his followers.
    In his devotion to the cause of the kingdom, Jesus burned all bridges
    behind him; he sacrificed all hindrances to the doing of his Father's will.

      196:2.8 Jesus blessed the poor because they were usually sincere and
    pious; he condemned the rich because they were usually wanton and
    irreligious. He would equally condemn the irreligious pauper and commend
    the consecrated and worshipful man of wealth.

      196:2.9 Jesus led men to feel at home in the world; he delivered them
    from the slavery of taboo and taught them that the world was not
    fundamentally evil. He did not long to escape from his earthly life; he
    mastered a technique of acceptably doing the Father's will while in the
    flesh. He attained an idealistic religious life in the very midst of a
    realistic world. Jesus did not share Paul's pessimistic view of humankind.
    The Master looked upon men as the sons of God and foresaw a magnificent and
    eternal future for those who chose survival. He was not a moral skeptic; he
    viewed man positively, not negatively. He saw most men as weak rather than
    wicked, more distraught than depraved. But no matter what their status,
    they were all God's children and his brethren.

      196:2.10 He taught men to place a high value upon themselves in time and
    in eternity. Because of this high estimate which Jesus placed upon men, he
    was willing to spend himself in the unremitting service of humankind. And
    it was this infinite worth of the finite that made the golden rule a vital
    factor in his religion. What mortal can fail to be uplifted by the
    extraordinary faith Jesus has in him?

      196:2.11 Jesus offered no rules for social advancement; his was a
    religious mission, and religion is an exclusively individual experience.
    The ultimate goal of society's most advanced achievement can never hope to
    transcend Jesus' brotherhood of men based on the recognition of the
    fatherhood of God. The ideal of all social attainment can be realized only
    in the coming of this divine kingdom.




                           3. THE SUPREMACY OF RELIGION



      196:3.1 Personal, spiritual religious experience is an efficient solvent
    for most mortal difficulties; it is an effective sorter, evaluator, and
    adjuster of all human problems. Religion does not remove or destroy human
    troubles, but it does dissolve, absorb, illuminate, and transcend them.
    True religion unifies the personality for effective adjustment to all
    mortal requirements. Religious faith -- the positive leading of the
    indwelling divine presence -- unfailingly enables the God-knowing man to
    bridge that gulf existing between the intellectual logic which recognizes
    the Universal First Cause as It and those positive affirmations of the soul
    which aver this First Cause is He, the heavenly Father of Jesus' gospel,
    the personal God of human salvation.

      196:3.2 There are just three elements in universal reality: fact, idea,
    and relation. The religious consciousness identifies these realities as
    science, philosophy, and truth. Philosophy would be inclined to view these
    activities as reason, wisdom, and faith -- physical reality, intellectual
    reality, and spiritual reality. We are in the habit of designating these
    realities as thing, meaning, and value.

      196:3.3 The progressive comprehension of reality is the equivalent of
    approaching God. The finding of God, the consciousness of identity with
    reality, is the equivalent of the experiencing of self-completion --
    self-entirety, self-totality. The experiencing of total reality is the full
    realization of God, the finality of the God-knowing experience.

      196:3.4 The full summation of human life is the knowledge that man is
    educated by fact, ennobled by wisdom, and saved -- justified -- by
    religious faith.

      196:3.5 Physical certainty consists in the logic of science; moral
    certainty, in the wisdom of philosophy; spiritual certainty, in the truth
    of genuine religious experience.

      196:3.6 The mind of man can attain high levels of spiritual insight and
    corresponding spheres of divinity of values because it is not wholly
    material. There is a spirit nucleus in the mind of man -- the Adjuster of
    the divine presence. There are three separate evidences of this spirit
    indwelling of the human mind:



      196:3.7 1. Humanitarian fellowship -- love. The purely animal mind may
    be gregarious for self-protection, but only the spirit-indwelt intellect is
    unselfishly altruistic and unconditionally loving.



      196:3.8 2. Interpretation of the universe -- wisdom. Only the
    spirit-indwelt mind can comprehend that the universe is friendly to the
    individual.



      196:3.9 3. Spiritual evaluation of life -- worship. Only the
    spirit-indwelt man can realize the divine presence and seek to attain a
    fuller experience in and with this foretaste of divinity.



      196:3.10 The human mind does not create real values; human experience
    does not yield universe insight. Concerning insight, the recognition of
    moral values and the discernment of spiritual meanings, all that the human
    mind can do is to discover, recognize, interpret, and choose.

      196:3.11 The moral values of the universe become intellectual
    possessions by the exercise of the three basic judgments, or choices, of
    the mortal mind:

    1. Self-judgment -- moral choice.

    2. Social-judgment -- ethical choice.

    3. God-judgment -- religious choice.

      196:3.12 Thus it appears that all human progress is effected by a
    technique of conjoint revelational evolution.

      196:3.13 Unless a divine lover lived in man, he could not unselfishly
    and spiritually love. Unless an interpreter lived in the mind, man could
    not truly realize the unity of the universe. Unless an evaluator dwelt with
    man, he could not possibly appraise moral values and recognize spiritual
    meanings. And this lover hails from the very source of infinite love; this
    interpreter is a part of Universal Unity; this evaluator is the child of
    the Center and Source of all absolute values of divine and eternal reality.

      196:3.14 Moral evaluation with a religious meaning -- spiritual insight
    -- connotes the individual's choice between good and evil, truth and error,
    material and spiritual, human and divine, time and eternity. Human survival
    is in great measure dependent on consecrating the human will to the
    choosing of those values selected by this spirit-value sorter -- the
    indwelling interpreter and unifier. Personal religious experience consists
    in two phases: discovery in the human mind and revelation by the indwelling
    divine spirit. Through oversophistication or as a result of the irreligious
    conduct of professed religionists, a man, or even a generation of men, may
    elect to suspend their efforts to discover the God who indwells them; they
    may fail to progress in and attain the divine revelation. But such
    attitudes of spiritual nonprogression cannot long persist because of the
    presence and influence of the indwelling Thought Adjusters.

      196:3.15 This profound experience of the reality of the divine
    indwelling forever transcends the crude materialistic technique of the
    physical sciences. You cannot put spiritual joy under a microscope; you
    cannot weigh love in a balance; you cannot measure moral values; neither
    can you estimate the quality of spiritual worship.

      196:3.16 The Hebrews had a religion of moral sublimity; the Greeks
    evolved a religion of beauty; Paul and his conferees founded a religion of
    faith, hope, and charity. Jesus revealed and exemplified a religion of
    love: security in the Father's love, with joy and satisfaction consequent
    upon sharing this love in the service of the human brotherhood.

      196:3.17 Every time man makes a reflective moral choice, he immediately
    experiences a new divine invasion of his soul. Moral choosing constitutes
    religion as the motive of inner response to outer conditions. But such a
    real religion is not a purely subjective experience. It signifies the whole
    of the subjectivity of the individual engaged in a meaningful and
    intelligent response to total objectivity -- the universe and its Maker.

      196:3.18 The exquisite and transcendent experience of loving and being
    loved is not just a psychic illusion because it is so purely subjective.
    The one truly divine and objective reality that is associated with mortal
    beings, the Thought Adjuster, functions to human observation apparently as
    an exclusively subjective phenomenon. Man's contact with the highest
    objective reality, God, is only through the purely subjective experience of
    knowing him, of worshiping him, of realizing sonship with him.

      196:3.19 True religious worship is not a futile monologue of
    self-deception. Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely
    real, with that which is the very source of reality. Man aspires by worship
    to be better and thereby eventually attains the best.

      196:3.20 The idealization and attempted service of truth, beauty, and
    goodness is not a substitute for genuine religious experience -- spiritual
    reality. Psychology and idealism are not the equivalent of religious
    reality. The projections of the human intellect may indeed originate false
    gods -- gods in man's image -- but the true God-consciousness does not have
    such an origin. The God-consciousness is resident in the indwelling spirit.
    Many of the religious systems of man come from the formulations of the
    human intellect, but the God-consciousness is not necessarily a part of
    these grotesque systems of religious slavery.

      196:3.21 God is not the mere invention of man's idealism; he is the very
    source of all such superanimal insights and values. God is not a hypothesis
    formulated to unify the human concepts of truth, beauty, and goodness; he
    is the personality of love from whom all of these universe manifestations
    are derived. The truth, beauty, and goodness of man's world are unified by
    the increasing spirituality of the experience of mortals ascending toward
    Paradise realities. The unity of truth, beauty, and goodness can only be
    realized in the spiritual experience of the God-knowing personality.

      196:3.22 Morality is the essential pre-existent soil of personal
    God-consciousness, the personal realization of the Adjuster's inner
    presence, but such morality is not the source of religious experience and
    the resultant spiritual insight. The moral nature is superanimal but
    subspiritual. Morality is equivalent to the recognition of duty, the
    realization of the existence of right and wrong. The moral zone intervenes
    between the animal and the human types of mind as morontia functions
    between the material and the spiritual spheres of personality attainment.

      196:3.23 The evolutionary mind is able to discover law, morals, and
    ethics; but the bestowed spirit, the indwelling Adjuster, reveals to the
    evolving human mind the lawgiver, the Father-source of all that is true,
    beautiful, and good; and such an illuminated man has a religion and is
    spiritually equipped to begin the long and adventurous search for God.

      196:3.24 Morality is not necessarily spiritual; it may be wholly and
    purely human, albeit real religion enhances all moral values, makes them
    more meaningful. Morality without religion fails to reveal ultimate
    goodness, and it also fails to provide for the survival of even its own
    moral values. Religion provides for the enhancement, glorification, and
    assured survival of everything morality recognizes and approves.

      196:3.25 Religion stands above science, art, philosophy, ethics, and
    morals, but not independent of them. They are all indissolubly interrelated
    in human experience, personal and social. Religion is man's supreme
    experience in the mortal nature, but finite language makes it forever
    impossible for theology ever adequately to depict real religious
    experience.

      196:3.26 Religious insight possesses the power of turning defeat into
    higher desires and new determinations. Love is the highest motivation which
    man may utilize in his universe ascent. But love, divested of truth,
    beauty, and goodness, is only a sentiment, a philosophic distortion, a
    psychic illusion, a spiritual deception. Love must always be redefined on
    successive levels of morontia and spirit progression.

      196:3.27 Art results from man's attempt to escape from the lack of
    beauty in his material environment; it is a gesture toward the morontia
    level. Science is man's effort to solve the apparent riddles of the
    material universe. Philosophy is man's attempt at the unification of human
    experience. Religion is man's supreme gesture, his magnificent reach for
    final reality, his determination to find God and to be like him.

      196:3.28 In the realm of religious experience, spiritual possibility is
    potential reality. Man's forward spiritual urge is not a psychic illusion.
    All of man's universe romancing may not be fact, but much, very much, is
    truth.



      196:3.29 Some men's lives are too great and noble to descend to the low
    level of being merely successful. The animal must adapt itself to the
    environment, but the religious man transcends his environment and in this
    way escapes the limitations of the present material world through this
    insight of divine love. This concept of love generates in the soul of man
    that superanimal effort to find truth, beauty, and goodness; and when he
    does find them, he is glorified in their embrace; he is consumed with the
    desire to live them, to do righteousness.



      196:3.30 Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and
    the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.



      196:3.31 The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better
    communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind.
    Man's greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well-balanced and
    sane effort to advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the
    dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to
    reach the borderland of spirit-consciousness -- contact with the divine
    presence. Such an experience constitutes God-consciousness, an experience
    mightily confirmative of the pre-existent truth of the religious experience
    of knowing God. Such spirit-consciousness is the equivalent of the
    knowledge of the actuality of sonship with God. Otherwise, the assurance of
    sonship is the experience of faith.

      196:3.32 And God-consciousness is equivalent to the integration of the
    self with the universe, and on its highest levels of spiritual reality.
    Only the spirit content of any value is imperishable. Even that which is
    true, beautiful, and good may not perish in human experience. If man does
    not choose to survive, then does the surviving Adjuster conserve those
    realities born of love and nurtured in service. And all these things are a
    part of the Universal Father. The Father is living love, and this life of
    the Father is in his Sons. And the spirit of the Father is in his Son's
    sons -- mortal men. When all is said and done, the Father idea is still the
    highest human concept of God.
