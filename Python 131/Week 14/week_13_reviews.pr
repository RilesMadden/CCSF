56 Great job, I appreciated the structure and error handling. If I had to offer any suggestion, I would recommend to consider having your function return your highest result, and subsequently handle the print statement outside of the function. In the event that you need to evaluate your function multiple times, you don't print the same thing multiple times. For this application, however, it's totally fine. Well done!
ep Nice job, I really appreciated the readability in the output as well as your overall structure. I'm definitely going to use a similar approach moving forward. If I had to make any suggestion, you could utilize the max() function as opposed to looping through and comparing each integer to your saved max integer. Something like max_integer = max([int(n) for n in num_bank]). Your check for if any integers exist could then be handled like 'if max_integer exists: print(max_integer), else: print('no integers found'). Great job overall! 
y4 Nice job! The code works well and is easy to read, as well as outputs the expected result. I did receive an error when I tried a file without any integers, however, so you could include another error type (ValueError) should the file have no integers. You can also use a generic catch all error statement in the event you didn't account for something, something like 'except Error as 'e': print(f"Error occurred: {e})'. I appreciated your method for finding integers, and was unaware you could do it that way. Nice!
98 Nice job, the code works well and gives the expected result. I did receive an error when I tried a file without any integers, however. One solution would be to include a generic catch all error statement in the event you didn't account for something, something like 'except Error as 'e': print(f"Error occurred: {e})'.

ke Nice job! However I'm not receiving my expected result. It looks like your code may not function correctly if the integers in the text are actually interpreted as strings and not integers ("9" vs 9). If you convert all of your digits to integers before your check for the max, the code works. Something like: max([int(n) for n in digit]). Aside from that, the code is easy to follow and understand what is happening. 
95 Nice effort! The function works as expected and I appreciate the error handling. Although you forgot to include the code to capture an input file, when I copied it and hardcoded a test file, it worked well. Aside from that, the code is straightforward and easy to read!
