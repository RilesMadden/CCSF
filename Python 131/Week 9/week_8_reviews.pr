64 Nice job, the code is concise and easy to follow. I thought the use of the is vs is not was a creative way to approach how to display the result.
yd Nice job! The code is easy to follow and runs without issue.
9s Nice job, the code runs without issue and produces an accurate result. My only suggestion would be to consider using underscores to separate words like sumofdice into sum_of_dice, as it removes any chance that someone would misunderstand you.
iu Nice job, I appreciated the approach using randrange instead of randint!
4y Nice job! My only note is that randint(x,y) is inclusive of y, unlike range(x,y), so you are including an extra integer in the calculation.
94 Nice job! I think you forgot to omit the comment about while loops, but otherwise nice job.
4j Code is well constructed, however the assignment was to use the sum and not the product of the dice. Otherwise, nice job!
