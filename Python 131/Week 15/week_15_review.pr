rv Great job, the code outputted successfully and in an easy to read way. 
82 Nice job, the code functioned without error and was easy to follow. I was a bit uncertain what your second function does, but I guess it could work if you then later reprinted the document or did additional functions with it. 
xk Great job, the code functions without error. I would double check the code for the largest integer function, however, as I didn't receive my expected result (got 32 instead of 20000000). I ran into errors myself where for some reason not all digits were counted as ints but instead strings, so they weren't considered by the MAX function. I fixed this by converting each digit to data type int, which solved the issue for me. Otherwise, great job!
4a Well done, the code was well laid out and easy to understand. If I had to make any suggestions, I would have liked to have been able to submit my own file to test the functions on instead of the hardcoded book sample.
kk Nice job, the code ran without error and the code easy to understand. The test file I inputted was large, so it wasn't easy to sort through to figure out what the functions were doing.
ju Nice job, the code runs successfully without error. I would suggest making the output a bit more reader friendly, as I was uncertain what some of the functions did based on the output alone.
zj Nice effort, however there aren't any lines in the code to execute the code or accept a test file. Looking at the code itself, it looks well written and nice choices for the functions within.
